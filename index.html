                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Hello! My name is Kevin Li! I work as a Performance Engineer at Arm down in Austin, TX. I currently specialize in
                        software tooling and methodology, especially when it comes to infrastructure performance analysis. I have experience with
                        automated benchmarking platforms, profiling tools, hands-on server configuration (we run the hardware lab), and even full-stack
                        engineering!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My passion has always been both building and breaking things. Ever since I was a kid, I loved legos, and I participated in many lego robotics demolition derbies
                        when I was a middle school student. This mindset carried on with me as I did my undergrad at UT Austin ðŸ¤ , where I studied Electrical and Computer Engineering (Class of 2022).
                    </p>
                    <p>Outside of work, I enjoy playing racquet sports (especially tennis and pickleball), maintaining my garden of peppermint plants, and laying in bed with a good book, TV show, or movie.
                        I'm a huge sci-fi fan, and I love <em>The Expanse</em> - I would argue that it is the best sci-fi show of all time. But I will also enjoy <em>Star Wars</em> and <em>Star Trek</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A fun fact about me is that I'm a descendant of Sun Tzu, who wrote <em>The Art of War</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>Thank you for checking out my website! Feel free to reach out - I love making new connections!</p>

                    <h2>What I'm Known For</h2>
                    <p><strong>Frontline Partner Engagements:</strong> I have actively partipated on the frontline of many Arm partner engagements, improving my discipline and contextual understanding</p>
                    <p><strong>Technical Documentation:</strong> Knowledge sharing is a force multiplier in organizations. Clear documentation (that exists) accelerates onboarding and collaboration with the added benefit of weakening silos. I have authored over 200+ Confluence pages, 5 videos, and 11 presentations in my two years at Arm so far.</p>
                    <p><strong>Codebase Reductions:</strong> I ensure that tasks are accomplished with the simplest code possible. Code maintainability is of critical concern, and any saved maintenance time can be used to fight other battles.</p>
                    <p><strong>Software Architecture:</strong> I am the software architect of our team, ensuring that design requirements are translated into actionable system plans. Defining the problem space is very important and interesting to me, which is why I pushed myself to improve my design skills. I am against abstract FAANG-style system designs that scale to billions of users when our user base is 50 people tops.</p>
                    <p><strong>Hardware Lab Work:</strong> I love working with my hands as well! I help out in our "Linus Tech Tips hardware lab", where I set up servers and other infrastructure! I've also participated in many hardware debugs, such as triaging misaligned UART pins.</p>
